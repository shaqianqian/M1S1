WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "my_Master/Mfunit.Inst_IPFunit/Sh72_SW1_f7" and its I1 input driver
   "my_Master/Mfunit.Inst_IPFunit/unit_IPcode[4]_AND_1607_o_inv1" were
   implemented suboptimally in the same slice component. The function generator
   could not be placed directly driving the F7 multiplexer. The design will
   exhibit suboptimal timing.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
